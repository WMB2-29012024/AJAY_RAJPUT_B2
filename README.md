Question 1: Write a for loop and log each element, starting from 0th index.
  ```javascript
  const numArr = [1, 234_45, 89,75, 4e9]
const strArr = ["asd", "qwe", "ert", "asdasdzxczxc"]
const mixArr = ["first", "234_45", {first: "Web", last: "Masters"}, true]

  ```
      
Question 2: Write a for loop starting from last index, and store each element in a new array. Log the array.
  ```javascript
  const numArr = [1, 234_45, 89,75, 4e9]
const strArr = ["asd", "qwe", "ert", "asdasdzxczxc"]
const mixArr = ["first", "234_45", {first: "Web", last: "Masters"}, true]
    

  ```
      
Question 3: Write a for-loop to reverse a string.
  ```javascript
  const strArr = "asdasdzxczxc";

  ```
      
Question 4: Write a for-loop to log every alternate element, starting from 0th index.
  ```javascript
  const numArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]    

  ```
      
Question 5: Write a for-loop to log every alternate element, starting from last index.
  ```javascript
  const numArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]    

  ```
      
Question 6: Write a for-loop to log every 4th element, starting from 0th index.
  ```javascript
  const numArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]    

  ```
      
Question 7: Write a for-loop to log every 4th element, starting from last index
  ```javascript
  const numArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]    

  ```
      
Question 8: Write a for-loop, and log the current and its immediate next element.
  ```javascript
  const numArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]    

  ```
      
Question 9: Write a for-loop, and log the current and its immediate previous element.
  ```javascript
  const numArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]    

  ```
      
Question 10: Write a for-loop, and log the current, its immediate previous, and its immediate next element,
Put the elements in a new object, and push that object in an array.
Return that array at the end of the loop
  ```javascript
  const numArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]    

  ```
      
Question 11: Write a for-loop and count frequency of each element in the array. Store the element and its frequency in an object.
  ```javascript
  const numArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]    

  ```
      
Question 12: Write a for-loop to log every element, starting from middle of the array
  ```javascript
  const numArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]    

  ```
      
Question 13: Write a for-loop:
- Start from 0th index, log every element,
- then go to next index, log all next elements,
- continue till last element
  ```javascript
  const numArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]    

  ```
      
Question 14: There are 2 different arrays, write a for-loop, that should log elements at the same index in both the arrays. The loop should run till the longer array's length.
  ```javascript
  const numArr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const numArr2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]    

  ```
      
Question 15: There are 2 different arrays, write a for-loop, that:
starts from 0th index, on array one,
matches all the elements of the array two,
if any element matches, logs true, and continue to next element
once all the elements are looped on array 2, go to next element in array 1, then continue from step 1.
  ```javascript
  const numArr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const numArr2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]    

  ```
