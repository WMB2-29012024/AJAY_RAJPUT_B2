## Javascript Foundations

**Week**: 4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Day:** 2

1.  Create an array/list of names of all primitive data types in javascript.
2.  Log the first and 5th element of the array/list.
3.  Log the last element of the array/list of length 6.
4.  Use push method to add new data in the array, and log the new length of the array, but without using the .length property.
5.  Use pop method to remove last element in the array, and log the removed element. Also log the length after removal of element.
6.  Use unshift method to add new data in the array, and log the new length of the array, but without using the .length property.
7.  Use shift method to remove first element in the array, and log the removed element. Also log the length of array after removal of element.
8.  Create an empty array and log its length.
9.  Create an array with only positive, and negative numbers, and log its length.
10.  Create an object with following keys = “name”, “age”, “email”, “phone”, “address”, “pincode”. And add their corresponding values, and log the object.
11.  Log the values from the object in an array, using Object.values.
12.  Log the keys from the object in an array, using Object.keys.
13.  Log the value of key “phone” in the object (square notation, dot notation any).
14.  Change the value of key “pincode” and log the new value (square notation, dot notation any).
15.  Delete the key “email” with its value from object, and log the object (square notation, dot notation any)
16.  Create an empty object and log it
17.  Create an object with key “primitivetypes”, and value should be an array of strings containing names of all primitive data types in JS
18.  Add another key “objectDataTypes” to the same object using square notation, and value should be an array of strings containing names of all object data types in JS, then log the object
19.  Add another key in the same object “version”, value should latest released version of JS (“es6”)
20.  Create an array of objects, where each object represents a primitive data type in JS, its keys should be like Eg: {“dataTypeName”: “string”, “type”: “primitive”, “isObject”: false, “isMultipleValuesAllowed”: false}
21.  Create a map of all non-primitive data types in JS with name and their data type Eg: [[“array”, “non-primitive”], [“set”, “non-primitive”]]
22.  Use the set method to add one more data type in the above map.set(“object”, “non-primitive”)
23.  Check and log true/false if any data type with value other than “non-primitive” is stored in the above map


**Create a separate file for each question with the naming convention ( Question1.js ) and add solution in that file.**
