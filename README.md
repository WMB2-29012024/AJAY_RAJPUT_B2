Question 1: Implement a todo list component using HTML, CSS and JS where User can add todos, mark todos as completed and filter todos
1. Each todo object should have a text property and a completed property.
2. Display the list of todos. Each todo should be displayed as a checkbox with the todo text as its label. The checkbox should be checked if the todo is completed.
3. The component should have a input field and a button for adding new todos. When the button is clicked, a new todo should be added to the list with the input fied’s value as its text and completed set to false.
4. When a todo checkbox is clicked, the completed property of that todo should be toggled.
5. The component should have buttons for filtering the list of todos. There should be three filters. “ALL”,“ACTIVE”,“COMPLETED”. “ALL” should show all the todos, “ACTIVE” should show todos where completed is false. “COMPLETED” should show only the todos where completed is true.
