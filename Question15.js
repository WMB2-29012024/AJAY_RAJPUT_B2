//  Question 15: There are 2 different arrays, write a for-loop, that:
starts from 0th index, on array one,
matches all the elements of the array two,
if any element matches, logs true, and continue to next element
once all the elements are looped on array 2, go to next element in array 1, then continue from step 1.

const numArr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const numArr2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
